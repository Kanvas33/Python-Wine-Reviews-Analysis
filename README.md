# Wine Reviews Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This **Python-based** wine reviews analysis project leverages various libraries and techniques to explore and analyze a dataset containing **almost 130,000 rows of wine-related data from around the world**. The project encompasses **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, geospatial visualization, and also specific analyses focusing on Italian wines**. The **goal** is to gain **valuable insights into wine trends, pricing, geographical distribution**, and use it as the **foundation for an exciting wine recommender web app that combines data analysis with NLP(Natural Language Processing)-powered recommendations**

This project serves as the foundation for a **wine recommender web app** that is **currently under development**. The **backend**, which includes the analysis conducted in this project, is complete. Additionally, the **frontend**, designed using **HTML and CSS**, **has been developed**. The **ongoing work** involves **integrating** the backend with the frontend to create a seamless user experience for wine enthusiasts looking for **personalized wine recommendations based on NLP(Natural Language Processing)-powered algorithms**.

The project aims to provide not only **valuable insights** into wine data but also a practical application that will enhance the **wine tasting and selection** process for users.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.

- **Exploratory Analysis**: Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of data, including insights on countries, wine varieties, and wine prices.

- **Top Wine Rankings**: Identify the top 50 most expensive wines and the highest-ranked wines globally.

- **Geospatial Analysis**: Utilize geospatial data visualization techniques to determine the top 10 countries with the most expensive wines.

- **Italian Wine Analysis**: Focus on Italian wines, ranking the top 50 Italian wines with scores ranging from 90 to 100 and analyzing wine data at the provincial level.

- **Cost vs. Benefit Analysis**: Evaluate the relationship between wine cost and wine quality (points) for wines from Tuscany.

- **Data Export**: Save relevant analysis results into CSV files and graphical visualizations as image files, along with specific insights in a text file.

- **Email Notification**: Automate the process of emailing CSV analysis results to a specified recipient.

## Project Workflow

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Cleanse the dataset by handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Generate visualizations and insights on wine country frequencies, wine variety frequencies, most expensive wines, and more.

- **Geospatial Visualization**: Create a map visualization to identify the top 10 countries with the most expensive wines.

- **Italian Wine Analysis**: Explore Italian wines, their rankings, provincial points, and wine variety statistics.

- **Cost vs. Benefit Analysis**: Analyze the relationship between wine cost and wine quality for Tuscany wines.

- **Data Export**: Save analysis results in CSV files, graphical visualizations as image files, and insights as a notepad file.

- **Email Notification**: Automate the emailing of CSV analysis results to a specified recipient.

## Achievements and Insights

- Identification of the most expensive wines globally and in specific countries.
- Visualizing the geographical distribution of expensive wines.
- Ranking and analyzing Italian wines, including provincial-level insights.
- Assessing the cost-benefit relationship for Tuscany wines.
